Project Title: WELLSIGHT: A Mapping System for Water Well Sites

Project Description:
  WellSight is a PHP-based web application that allows local governments and contractors to record, manage, and view potential water well sites through an interactive map. The system provides a centralized platform for storing site information, managing user roles, and monitoring project approvals. By simplifying the process into a structured database and visual map, WellSight helps reduce duplication of effort and improves transparency in water well site planning.
